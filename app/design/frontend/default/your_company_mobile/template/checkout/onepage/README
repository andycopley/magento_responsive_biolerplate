For some reason there is a mysterious issue with these checkout steps.
You will find that when trying to edit these pages, nothing will change.
You can edit the your_company_mobile, your_company, or even the base template
files and NOTHING will change. This is noted and it will be resolved in the
very near future. If you know a work around to resolve this issue OTHER than
CSS, please fork the project with your fix and you will be thanked by me
personally and a nice credit will be given to you in all of the files within the
onepage directory :)
