your_company
============

"your_company" is a boilerplate for magento theme development. Founded on the base magento theme (1.7.0.2 to be exact), we completely restructured the entire theme to use the Skeleton CSS Framework. Your magento theme will look good on just about any device imaginable.

WHO SHOULD USE THIS:
This starter template is right for anyone who has knowledge of HTML, CSS, and basic PHP skills. The default look of the theme is intentionally minimalistic and only containes the necessary structural code to make magento function with the default features. The extra images and code has been removed for your design pleasure.

I WANT TO CONTRUBUTE TO THIS PROJECT:
Excellent! Please feel free to contribute to this project!

IS THERE A SAMPLE I CAN SEE:
Yes, we have a sample setup with the default magento content here:
